# Logic_Building_with_Java
Author: Abhishek Bhoite

Logic_Building_with_Java is a well-structured collection of Java programs crafted to strengthen logical reasoning and programming fundamentals. This repository is designed with a strong emphasis on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles — including encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and class-based design.

The repository includes problems ranging from basic syntax to more complex class hierarchies and real-world simulations, making it an ideal resource for:
Seeking clarity in OOP design patterns
To build clean, modular, and maintainable Java code

Each program is clearly documented, follows best practices, and focuses on problem-solving using core Java and OOP constructs — without relying on frameworks, to maintain focus on raw logic building.
This repository provides a practical approach to mastering both logic and OOP thinking in Java.
